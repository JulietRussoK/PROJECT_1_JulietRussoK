Are you grieving? You are not alone.    

Have you lost a loved one? It's one of life's most painful challenges.  
 

Need a job? Career advice? Bible texts will make a difference today.   
 

Bible verses that are of course politely worded to comfort you.     
 

I would never have gotten looked at alone. It was the draw for ... a response. </p> </body>
