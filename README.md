Are you grieving? You are not alone.

Have you lost a loved one? It's one of life's most painful challenges.  

Need a job? Career advice? Bible texts will make a difference today.  

Bible verses that are of course politely worded to comfort you. 

I would never have gotten looked at alone. It was the draw for ... a response.
